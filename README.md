Biomorph
===========================================

For his 1986 book The Blind Watchmaker, Richard Dawkins developed a program that created “biomorphs”: virtual creatures created by a computer simulation. The simulation, called Biomorph, was developed in order to demonstrate the power of arti selection.

Recently, in an effort to better understand how the Biomorph program worked, I decided to implement it myself in JavaScript using the HTML5 canvas element. [The result of this endeavour can be found here.](http://cdmckay.org/biomorph) Read more to learn how to use the Biomorph program.

To learn more about how the program works, [please see this blog post](http://cdmckay.org/blog/2010/06/06/biomorph-js-natural-selection-in-javascript/).
